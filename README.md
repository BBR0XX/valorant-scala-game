# Valorant Scala Game (GUI)
This GUI application is two-player turn-based game where players take control of characters called “Agents” and battle each other using an assortment of different weapons until one is victorious. The game was developed using Scala to showcase the concept of object-oriented programming.
<p>
It is based on the free-to-play FPS tactical hero shooter game of the same name developed by Riot Games. In the original game, players can select characters with unique abilities and use different types of guns to shoot at their enemies. Hence, the goal was focused on bringing the main gunplay of the original game and translate that into a turn-based game while the unique abilities of the characters are omitted due to the limited time of the project. However, the ability to choose characters and maps are still retained as they are a key part of the original game’s identity. 
<p>
The game has several different characters and maps for players to choose from to set up their battle. Each player also has access to their own “Shop” where they can use credits to purchase new weapons each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

# Features 

**Agent & Map Selection**
<br>
Each player can select their Agent in the Agent Select Screen which will set the character images that is displayed during the main game. They can also select the map that want their battle to take place in. There are 6 maps to choose from and each selection will determine the background image that is shown during the main game.  

**Gameplay**
<br>
During the game, players can do damage to each other by clicking on the weapon buttons. They have 3 types of weapons which are melee weapon, primary weapon, and sidearm. Each weapon type has their own strengths and weakness which make each weapon different from each other and suitable for different situations. The ammo of each weapon is displayed below. The player will not be able to use a weapon if its ammo is zero. The game ends when one of the player’s health reaches zero. 

**Shop**
<br>
Each player has a shop button which opens the shop. It allows players to purchase new weapons using credits. Each player starts with 500 credits and can earn bonus credits by landing critical hits (Weapon does maximum damage). This feature brings more variety to the gameplay as players can use different guns to suit their playstyle or execute different tactics. For example, players can either spend credits to purchase better guns at the start to gain an early advantage or save up their credits to purchase more powerful guns in the later stages of a game to turn the tides on their opponent. The shop also allows players to purchase new guns whenever one of their guns ran out of ammo.
